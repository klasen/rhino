## What is BSF?

The [`Bean Scripting Framework (or BSF)`](http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/) was originally developed by IBM and now published as open source as a project at the Apache Software Foundation. It provides a framework for using a number of scripting languages with Java. Rhino is one of the supported languages.

This framework has been embedded in a number of open source projects, including the XSL processor [Xalan](http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/) and the XML/Java build tool [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/). See [Xalan-Java Extensions](http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/extensions.html) for more information on adding JavaScript to XSL and the description of the optional Script task in the [Apache Ant Manual](http://ant.apache.org/manual/) for using scripting in Ant build files.

## Using BSF with Rhino

Now that the Apache Jakarta `Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)`, version 2.4.0, has been officially released, you can use Rhino easily with BSF. See [http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html](http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html).
