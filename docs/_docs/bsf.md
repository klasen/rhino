## What is BSF?

The (`Bean Scripting Framework (or BSF)`)[http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/] was originally developed by IBM and now published as open source as a project at the Apache Software Foundation. It provides a framework for using a number of scripting languages with Java. Rhino is one of the supported languages.

This framework has been embedded in a number of open source projects, including the XSL processor (Xalan)[http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/] and the XML/Java build tool (Ant)[http://ant.apache.org/]. See (Xalan-Java Extensions)[http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/extensions.html] for more information on adding JavaScript to XSL and the description of the optional Script task in the (Apache Ant Manual)[http://ant.apache.org/manual/] for using scripting in Ant build files.

## Using BSF with Rhino

Now that the Apache Jakarta `Bean Scripting Framework (BSF)`, version 2.4.0, has been officially released, you can use Rhino easily with BSF. See (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/index.html)[http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/index.html].
